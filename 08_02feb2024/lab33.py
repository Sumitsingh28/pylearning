# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

a = int (input ("enter first number "))

b = int(input("enter the second number"))

print (a==b)

print(a>b)

print (a<b)



print ("both the number are equal :", a==b)

print ("A is greater than B :", a>b)

print ("B is greater than A :", a<b)
